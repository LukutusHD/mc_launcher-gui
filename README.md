# MC Client

This project should become a MineCraft Launcher written in Javascript.

Its main porpoise is to be an alternative Launcher for our Minecraft Project,
where we distribute our mods, configuration and so on.

It could be used as starting point for an alternate project as well.

## Notice
This project is only in its early stage. Don't expect anything special soon.

## Plans for the future
As this plugin is only in a very early stage, only the parsing of the JSON work.

But as the project progresses, some features may be added.

Currently planned is the following list (may change in the future):

- A GUI using the GitHubs [Electron API](https://electron.atom.io/).
- Some nice integration in our Server (VIP user Display, Discord Link, etc.)
- Automatic mod update, config patches, patches in the server list
- Who is online function

Its an ambitious plan, but it's also a great opportunity, to test something new
